'The Hitchhiker's Guide to Happiness' is a data science project that I have done in my master's Data science course along with my project mate. 

These days, there are a lot of things that can make you sad. A global pandemic has taken its toll on humanity and the political situation has become very tense in many countries. So, as there are many obvious answers to the question “What makes people sad these days?” we wanted to ask a different question: Is it possible to categorize happy moments into topics that can be utilized to predict and recommend equally satisfying experiences? To answer this question, we used the HappyDB dataset [1] which contains over 100.000 descriptions of happy moments crowd-sourced by workers on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. We chose the HappyDB because we thought it is a very interesting and wholesome dataset that would maybe bring some joy to people by talking about positive experiences. Especially during dire times. we wanted to provide a more lighthearted approach to science. Our model  was trained in a way that it could be able to answer the following research questions: 

(1) What is the best way to cluster descriptions of happy moments
into fitting topics?

(2) Using our model, how accurately can we predict the topic
or category of a happy moment?

(3) Can we use our model as a “recommendation system” for
new happy moments to be experienced? If so, how effective
can our model be?

We use popular python libraries and NLP techniques to build our model.
